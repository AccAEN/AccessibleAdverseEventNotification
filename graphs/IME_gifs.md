This is a list of DAEN cases with Adverse Events (AEs) from a COVID-19 vaccine that included an Important Medical Event (a serious reaction). Out of the 121,406 cases with any AE from a COVID-19 vaccine, 23,579 had an IME. The video is [here](https://github.com/AccAEN/AccessibleAdverseEventNotification/blob/main/graphs/IMEs03.mp4?raw=true). I had to break these gifs up due to a file size limit in github.
