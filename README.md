# AccessibleAdverseEventNotification
Making the DAEN information accessible.

The purpose of this repository is to make the information on Australian COVID-19 adverse events accessible. The Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA) keeps a database of adverse reactions to medications including the COVID-19 vaccines. This Database of Adverse Event Notifications (DAEN) is available to the public via [this awful web interface](https://apps.tga.gov.au/PROD/DAEN/daen-entry.aspx).

The DAEN website doesn't provide information in a format that might be useful for analysis. Instead you have to scrape the information by entering each individual day and collecting the results from two tables which might span multiple pages. I've already done that and the code is [here](insert link to code) (this code isn't particularly reliable, but it is good enough to get the job done).

Figure 1 [DAEN cases.png](graphs/DAEN%20cases.png) shows some of the basic information such as number of adverse events and deaths reported each day for the COVID-19 vaccines, myocarditis, pericarditis and the more general term cardiac disorder.
