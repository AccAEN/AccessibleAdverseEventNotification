The file AIHW_2023-02-22.7zip contains the .json files downloaded via the API on 22 Feb 2023.

The file AIHW_total.tsv.7z contains a tab separated values file and can be opended in a text editor. It can be pasted into excel, but the number of rows in this file exceeds the limits of excel.

The AIHW_pivot_chart_2017-07_up.xlsx file contains data from July 2017 or later due to the limitations of github file uploading. This can be upgraded to go back to July 2013 by downloading the file AIHW_for_pasting_to_excel.7z, extracting the txt file and pasting into excel on top of cell A1 on worksheet 'Sheet1'. Then refresh the Pivot Table.
