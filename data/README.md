These files have been re-scraped at times to keep the information relatively up to date. The archive directories keep a record of old scrapes. Generally each day is scraped as soon as it is available (i.e. whatever day was two weeks ago).

On 1/3/2022 re-scraped from 1/1/2022 to 15/2/2022 to see if there were any significant changes in reports for the 5-11 year old children. This was not a re-scrape of everything, only the selected date range.

Everything was re-scraped on 15/2/2022-16/2/2022 (everything to 1/2/2022). The previous scrapings are found in data/archive_2022_02_01 along with diff comparisons with the newer scrape. The new re-scraping found 12 more deaths (was 745, now 757 dead), 22 more myocarditis cases (was 1247, now 1269), 44 fewer pericarditis cases (was 2781, now 2737) and 2040 more cardiac disorder cases (was 11085, now 13125).

The original data set was scraped on 19/11/2021, and then added to daily as each extra day was available. A whole lot of new adverse events have appeared dated mid-September to mid-October. There was a net decrease of 131 pericarditis and net gain of 3 myocarditis adverse events between the earlier (kept in archive_2022-11-19) and more recent scraping (now archive_2022_02_01).
